<h3>Reflection</h3>

<p class="justified-text">
    From understanding the role of engineering managers in the business world to exploring different management processes, engineering management has paved the way for understanding the principles of successfully managing a business. Throughout the discussion, new knowledge has been gained, and previous ideas have been refined regarding the various roles engineers play in the business world. This learning experience has highlighted the crucial role of engineering managers as key figures who help shape industries in a more organized and efficient manner. 
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
    In relation, for the Course Learning Outcome 1 (CLO1), essential roots for understanding the concept of engineering management is discussed. It focuses mainly on the introduction of engineering management that assists us in having direct knowledge about how engineers works as managers in the business environment. It expanded my understanding that engineers are not only proficient in math-centric subjects but also possess strong foundations in essential soft skills, including leadership, problem-solving, and communication. These skills allow engineers to penetrate different functions in the society such as teachers, consultants, researchers, and the like that assist everyone to have effective and efficient progress. It also enable me to visualize the difference between engineering managers and engineers as engineering managers take a step in special training in engineering management to develop required knowledge for managing a business through experience. Additionally, engineering managers are considered to be the backbone of any project as they are the one that plan, order, and organize the project, which make the whole process understandable and less complicated for the eyes of others.
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
    For Course Learning Outcome 2 (CLO2), four topics are discussed by different reporters, which enable us to use our soft skills that we learn in CLO1. This particular chapter focuses on the management processes to ensure that the business will grow and reach its maximum profitability through the works of engineering managers. To begin with, Chapter 2: Decision-making. This topic gave us real-life importance of developing a decision based on how the business will gain more value in the long run, while also discussing about the collateral damage that may arise, so that engineering managers can plan to develop solutions to address it. Second, Chapter 3: Managing Product and Service Operations. This chapter solely delivers its purpose to teach us about how engineering managers fill the shoes of operations managers to develop high quality products and services. This allow us to consider the different transformation process such as batch flow, job shop, and others, to determine the best fit for a business. Identifying the most suitable process ensures smooth and consistent transactions with customers. Third, Chapter 4: Managing the Marketing Function highlights the importance of marketing in making a business well-known to the public. I learned that marketing is not limited to advertising but encompasses the entire business processâ€”from product development and pricing to place distribution and promotion. It begins with developing a product or service that meets the needs of a specific target market. Once the target market is identified, the business is established. Marketing strategies, including advertisements, then play a crucial role in creating positive customer engagement, ensuring that the business remains memorable and gains loyal customers. And Lastly, Chapter 5: Managing the Finance Function emphasizes the importance of managing cash flow to sustain a business. Starting a business requires careful financial management to maintain sufficient capital and generate profit. An engineering manager must effectively handle profits, secure reliable funding sources, and assess financial risks to have strong financial management, building a sustainable business. This lesson helped me understand that the growth and success of a business depend on how well financial resources are controlled and utilized by those managing it.
</p>

<p class="justified-text">
	Overall, this learning experience has reinforced the significance of engineering managers as key drivers of organizational success. They are not only responsible for overseeing projects but also ensuring that businesses operate efficiently and profitably. With their unique blend of technical and managerial skills, engineering managers help shape industries, drive innovation, and contribute to economic progress. Understanding these principles has provided me with a solid foundation for appreciating the dynamic role of engineering management in today's business world.
